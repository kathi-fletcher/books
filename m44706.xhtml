Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape. These are the cells of the spongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). The air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange between the leaf and the outside atmosphere.

The pattern of leaf arrangement may be alternate, opposite, or spiral, while leaf form may be simple or compound. Leaf tissue consists of the epidermis, which forms the outermost cell layer, and mesophyll and vascular tissue, which make up the inner portion of the leaf. In some plant species, leaf form is modified to form structures such as tendrils, spines, bud scales, and needles.</p> </div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp108753440">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp137709888"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp5940192"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp99851616">The stalk of a leaf is known as the ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp22733136" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">petiole</li> <li class="item">lamina</li> <li class="item">stipule</li> <li class="item">rachis</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp8149328"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm12121504">A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp85203904"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp38560736"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp124310112">Leaflets are a characteristic of ________ leaves.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm45367472" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">alternate</li> <li class="item">whorled</li> <li class="item">compound</li> <li class="item">opposite</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp21604752"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp45461344">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp28882000"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp23964272"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp37528224">Cells of the ________ contain chloroplasts.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp73855504" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">epidermis</li> <li class="item">vascular tissue</li> <li class="item">stomata</li> <li class="item">mesophyll</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp77198496"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp168717968">D</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm14688192"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp71031424"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp6293904">Which of the following is most likely to be found in a desert environment?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idp46388992" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">broad leaves to capture sunlight</li> <li class="item">spines instead of leaves</li> <li class="item">needle-like leaves</li> <li class="item">wide, flat leaves that can float</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp46598256"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm17141664">B</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp9096976">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp137751024"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp38595568"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp20848096">How do dicots differ from monocots in terms of leaf structure?</p> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp125075296"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idm48012864">Monocots have leaves with parallel venation, and dicots have leaves with reticulate, net-like venation.</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idm25829888"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp81212288"> <p class="para" id="fs-idp72427056">Describe an example of a plant with leaves that are adapted to cold temperatures.</p> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp45241680"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp46407568">Conifers such as spruce, fir, and pine have needle-shaped leaves with sunken stomata, helping to reduce water loss.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body>
