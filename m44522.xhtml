Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (<a href="/#fig-ch15_01_01" data-target-id="fig-ch15_01_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.</p> <figure id="fig-ch15_01_01"><span class="media" id="fs-id1695436" alt="Structures of the twenty amino acids are given. Six amino acids&#8212;glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, methionine, and isoleucine&#8212;are non-polar and aliphatic, meaning they do not have a ring. Six amino acids&#8212;serine, threonine, cysteine, proline, asparagine, and glutamate&#8212;are polar but uncharged. Three amino acids&#8212;lysine, arginine, and histidine&#8212;are positively charged. Two amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, are negatively charged. Three amino acids&#8212;phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan&#8212;are nonpolar and aromatic."> <img src="Figure_15_01_01.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="500"/> </span> <figcaption>Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown.

The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs. Because the DNA genome is so central to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. However, the translation to protein is still systematic and <span class="term">colinear</span>, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.</p><figure id="fig-ch15_01_02"><span class="media" id="fs-id2681268" alt="To make a protein, genetic information encoded by the DNA must be transcribed onto an mRNA molecule.

Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (4<sup class="sup">2</sup>). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (4<sup class="sup">3</sup>), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was <span class="term">degenerate</span>. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called <span class="term">codons</span>. The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet <span class="term">reading frame</span>, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (<a href="/#fig-ch15_01_05" data-target-id="fig-ch15_01_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1565817">Scientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they specified (<a href="/#fig-ch15_01_04" data-target-id="fig-ch15_01_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch15_01_04"><span class="media" id="fs-id2989543" alt="Figure shows all 64 codons.

These triplets are called <span class="term">nonsense codons</span>, or stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id913366">The genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin.
