The thermal energy can be felt on exposed skin a few meters away, and its light can be seen for kilometers. (credit: Kevin S.

We feel the warmth of the summer Sun, the chill of a clear summer night, the heat of coffee after a winter stroll, and the cooling effect of our sweat. Heat transfer is maintained by temperature differences. Manifestations of <span class="term" id="import-auto-id1477290">heat transfer</span>&#8212;the movement of heat energy from one place or material to another&#8212;are apparent throughout the universe. Heat from beneath Earth&#8217;s surface is brought to the surface in flows of incandescent lava. The Sun warms Earth&#8217;s surface and is the source of much of the energy we find on it. Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide threaten to trap more of the Sun&#8217;s energy, perhaps fundamentally altering the ecosphere. In space, supernovas explode, briefly radiating more heat than an entire galaxy does.</p> <p class="para" id="import-auto-id1805837">What is heat? How do we define it? How is it related to temperature? What are heat&#8217;s effects? How is it related to other forms of energy and to work? We will find that, in spite of the richness of the phenomena, there is a small set of underlying physical principles that unite the subjects and tie them to other fields.</p> <figure id="import-auto-id1202103"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1799416" alt="Image of the lower end of a glass thermometer containing alcohol and a red dye."> <img src="Figure_14_00_02.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="250"/> </span> <figcaption>In a typical thermometer like this one, the alcohol, with a red dye, expands more rapidly than the glass containing it. When the thermometer&#8217;s temperature increases, the liquid from the bulb is forced into the narrow tube, producing a large change in the length of the column for a small change in temperature.
