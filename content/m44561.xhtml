(a) Saguaro (<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Carnegiea gigantea</em>) can soak up 750 liters of water in a single rain storm, enabling these cacti to survive the dry conditions of the Sonora desert in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. (b) The Andean semiaquatic lizard (<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Potamites montanicola</em>) discovered in Peru in 2010 lives between 1,570 to 2,100 meters in elevation, and, unlike most lizards, is nocturnal and swims. Scientists still do no know how these cold-blood animals are able to move in the cold (10 to 15&#176;C) temperatures of the Andean night.

Its power is that it provides direction for predictions about living things that are borne out in experiment after experiment. The Ukrainian-born American geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously wrote that &#8220;nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution.&#8221;<sup class="sup"><div class="footnote" id="fs-idp6043216">Theodosius Dobzhansky. &#8220;Biology, Molecular and Organismic.&#8221; <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">American Zoologist</em> 4, no. 4 (1964): 449.</div></sup> He meant that the tenet that all life has evolved and diversified from a common ancestor is the foundation from which we approach all questions in biology.</p></body>
