No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move. Collectively, this network of protein fibers is known as the <span class="term">cytoskeleton</span>. There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (<a href="/#fig-ch04-05-01" data-target-id="fig-ch04-05-01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Here, we will examine each.</p> <figure id="fig-ch04-05-01"><figcaption>Microfilaments thicken the cortex around the inner edge of a cell; like rubber bands, they resist tension. Microtubules are found in the interior of the cell where they maintain cell shape by resisting compressive forces. Intermediate filaments are found throughout the cell and hold organelles in place.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-id2076540" data-alt="Microfilaments line the inside of the plasma membrane, whereas microfilaments radiate out from the center of the cell.

They function in cellular movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin (<a href="/#fig-ch04-05-02" data-target-id="fig-ch04-05-02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). For this reason, microfilaments are also known as actin filaments.</p> <figure id="fig-ch04-05-02"><figcaption>Microfilaments are made of two intertwined strands of actin.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-id1857136" data-alt="This illustration shows two actin filaments wound together.

Each actin filament is composed of many actin subunits connected together to form a chain." width="275"/> </span> </figure><p class="para" id="fs-id1773165">Actin is powered by ATP to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein called myosin. This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in animal cells and cytoplasmic streaming, which is the circular movement of the cell cytoplasm in plant cells. Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells. When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1973921">Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move. White blood cells (your body&#8217;s infection-fighting cells) make good use of this ability. They can move to the site of an infection and phagocytize the pathogen.</p> <div class="note" id="fs-id1685480" data-class="interactive"><div class="title"><span class="label"/>Link to Learning</div> <span class="media" id="fs-id1608815" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="chasing_bcteria.png" data-mime-type="image/png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="130"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-id1364358">To see an example of a white blood cell in action, click <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chasing_bcteria" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chasing_bcteria">here</a> and watch a short time-lapse video of the cell capturing two bacteria.

With a diameter of about 25 nm, <span class="term">microtubules</span> are the widest components of the cytoskeleton.

In fact, in animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. In eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as discussed below.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id1454036">Flagella and Cilia</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1953693">To refresh your memory, <span class="term">flagella</span> (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell (for example, sperm, <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Euglena</em>). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella. When <span class="term">cilia</span> (singular = cilium) are present, however, many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane. They are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1886246">Despite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called a &#8220;9 + 2 array.&#8221; This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets, surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (<a href="/#fig-ch04-05-05" data-target-id="fig-ch04-05-05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch04-05-05"><figcaption>This transmission electron micrograph of two flagella shows the 9 + 2 array of microtubules: nine microtubule doublets surround a single microtubule doublet.
