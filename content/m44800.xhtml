(credit: modification of work by Andrey Belenko)</figcaption> <span class="media" id="fs-idm15587840" data-alt="Photo shows intersecting highways and secondary roads."> <img src="Figure_40_00_01.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" alt="Photo shows intersecting highways and secondary roads." width="600"/> </span> </figure> <p class="para" id="fs-idp123148240">Most animals are complex multicellular organisms that require a mechanism for transporting nutrients throughout their bodies and removing waste products. The circulatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells in the early evolution of animals to a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body. This extensive network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste, which are byproducts of respiration.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp87826144">At the core of the human circulatory system is the heart. The size of a clenched fist, the human heart is protected beneath the rib cage. Made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle, it pumps blood throughout the body and to the heart itself. Heart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses that the brain and endocrine hormones help to regulate. Understanding the heart&#8217;s basic anatomy and function is important to understanding the body&#8217;s circulatory and respiratory systems.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idm24730624">The gas exchange that occurs is essential to the function of the circulatory system. In humans, other mammals, and birds, blood is refreshed with oxygen exchanged through the lungs. In fish, blood is refreshed through the gills. In more primitive animals, such as Cnidarians, gas exchange occurs through diffusion. Throughout animal evolution, circulatory systems have adapted to changing morphology and environments.</p> </body>
