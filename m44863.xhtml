The Asian carp in the inset photograph were harvested from the Little Calumet River in Illinois in May, 2010, using rotenone, a toxin often used as an insecticide, in an effort to learn more about the population of the species.

This is a risk now on many rivers and canal systems in Illinois and Missouri because of the presence of Asian carp.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp21015584">This fish&#8212;actually a group of species including the silver, black, grass, and big head carp&#8212;has been farmed and eaten in China for over 1000 years. It is one of the most important aquaculture food resources worldwide. In the United States, however, Asian carp is considered a dangerous invasive species that disrupts community structure and composition to the point of threatening native species.</p> </body>
