Analogously, a plasma membrane&#8217;s functions involve movement within the cell and across boundaries in the process of intracellular and intercellular activities.

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable. This means that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell, while other materials cannot move freely, but require the use of a specialized structure, and occasionally, even energy investment for crossing.</p> </body>
