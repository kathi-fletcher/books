Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id846709">Types and Functions of Proteins</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id2862975"><span class="term">Enzymes</span>, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes. It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2781285"><span class="term">Hormones</span> are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction.

Protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds.

Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic side chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also known as basic amino acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure. Proline is an exception to the standard structure of an animo acid since its amino group is not separate from the side chain (<a href="/#fig-ch03_04_02" data-target-id="fig-ch03_04_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1506615">Amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation.

As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting chain is known as a polypeptide. Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end. This end is called the N terminal, or the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the C or carboxyl terminal. While the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, often have bound non-peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function. After protein synthesis (translation), most proteins are modified. These are known as post-translational modifications. They may undergo cleavage, phosphorylation, or may require the addition of other chemical groups. Only after these modifications is the protein completely functional.</p> <div class="interactive" id="fs-id1281011"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Link to Learning</div><span class="media" id="fs-id2573481" alt="QR Code representing a URL"> <img src="protein_synth.png" data-mime-type="image/png" width="150"/> </span> <p class="para" id="fs-id2115867">Click through the steps of protein synthesis in this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/protein_synth" data-window="new" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/protein_synth">interactive tutorial</a>.</p> </div><div class="evolution" id="fs-id1432930"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Evolution Connection</div><p class="para" id="fs-id2270232"><span class="title">The Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome c</span>Cytochrome c is an important component of the electron transport chain, a part of cellular respiration, and it is normally found in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion.

Because this essential protein&#8217;s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years.

When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function.</p> </div> <div class="art-exercise section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1831067">Art Connections</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2762947"><div class="problem" id="fs-id1452875"> <p class="para" id="fs-id1876403"><a href="/#fig-ch03_04_02" data-target-id="fig-ch03_04_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Which categories of amino acid would you expect to find on the surface of a soluble protein, and which would you expect to find in the interior?

In membrane proteins, nonpolar and hydrophobic amino acid side chains associate with the hydrophobic tails of phospholipids, while polar and charged amino acid side chains interact with the polar head groups or with the aqueous solution. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes, positively and negatively charged amino acid side chains interact with one another in the interior of a protein, and polar or charged amino acid side chains that interact with a ligand can be found in the ligand binding pocket.</p> </div> </div></div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1235723">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2385460"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1972642"><p class="para" id="fs-id2279879">The monomers that make up proteins are called ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id2571408" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">nucleotides</li> <li class="item">disaccharides</li> <li class="item">amino acids</li> <li class="item">chaperones</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1951079"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1354131">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1837286"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1712352"><p class="para" id="fs-id1443260">The <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#945;</em> helix and the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#946;</em>-pleated sheet are part of which protein structure?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1318146" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">primary</li> <li class="item">secondary</li> <li class="item">tertiary</li> <li class="item">quaternary</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1447624"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id1911096">B</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1793964">Free Response</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2689439"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2689119"><p class="para" id="fs-id1292460">Explain what happens if even one amino acid is substituted for another in a polypeptide chain.

The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions is the secondary structure of the protein. The three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary structure, created in part by chemical interactions such as hydrogen bonds between polar side chains, van der Waals interactions, disulfide linkages, and hydrophobic interactions. Some proteins are formed from multiple polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body>
