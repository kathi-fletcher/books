Whereas some protist species are essential components of the food chain and generators of biomass, others function in the decomposition of organic materials. Still other protists are dangerous human pathogens or causative agents of devastating plant diseases.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm723488">Primary Producers/Food Sources</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idm21756592">Protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae use sunlight to fix inorganic carbon. In this symbiotic relationship, these protists provide nutrients for coral polyps (<a href="/#fig-ch23_04_01" data-target-id="fig-ch23_04_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. In turn, the corals provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. This type of symbiotic relationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reef-building corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.</p> <figure id="fig-ch23_04_01"> <span class="media" id="fs-idp64610240" alt="This underwater photo shows coral polyps.

As primary producers, protists feed a large proportion of the world&#8217;s aquatic species. (On land, terrestrial plants serve as primary producers.)
