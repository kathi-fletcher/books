A bacterial &#8220;chromosome&#8221; is a covalently closed circle that is not as tightly coiled or organized as eukaryotic DNA. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid. In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant <span class="term">plasmids</span>, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id671101">Transcription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis. The region of unwinding is called a <span class="term">transcription bubble.</span> Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene, which is called the <span class="term">template strand</span>. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the <span class="term">nontemplate strand</span>. The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides. In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in A&#8211;T pairing in a DNA double helix.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1520179">The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site, or the <span class="term">initiation site</span>. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated <span class="term">upstream</span>. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with &#8220;+&#8221; numbering and are called <span class="term">downstream</span> nucleotides.</p> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id2899946">Initiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id2321141">Prokaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic transcription often covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify more than one protein.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2117424">Our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Escherichia coli</em>, a well-studied bacterial species. Although some differences exist between transcription in <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">E. coli</em> and transcription in archaea, an understanding of <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">E. coli </em>transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id2016560">Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1694517">Prokaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. In <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">E. coli</em>, the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#945;</em>, <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#945;</em>, <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#946;</em>, and <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#946;</em>' comprise the polymerase <span class="term">core enzyme</span>. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each subunit has a unique role; the two <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#945;</em>-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#946;</em>-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent &#8220;recently born&#8221; mRNA molecule; and the <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#946;</em>' binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#963;</em>, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#963;</em>, the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the <span class="term">holoenzyme</span>.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-id653506">Prokaryotic Promoters</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-id1236812">A <span class="term">promoter</span> is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoter <span class="term">consensus</span> sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species (<a href="/#fig-ch15_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch15_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). The -10 consensus sequence, called the <span class="term">TATA box</span>, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence, TTGACA, is recognized and bound by <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#963;</em>. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A&#8211;T-rich TATA box facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.</p> <figure id="fig-ch15_02_01"><span class="media" id="fs-id1482493" alt="Illustration shows the &#963; subunit of RNA polymerase bound to two consensus sequences that are 10 and 35 bases upstream of the transcription start site.

The dissociation of <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">&#963;</em> allows the core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (<a href="/#fig-ch15_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch15_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.</p> <figure id="fig-ch15_02_02"><span class="media" id="fs-id3014452" alt="Illustration shows RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase.

Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. One is protein-based and the other is RNA-based. <span class="term">Rho-dependent termination</span> is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase. The interaction with rho releases the mRNA from the transcription bubble.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2629848"><span class="term">Rho-independent termination</span> is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C&#8211;G nucleotides. The mRNA folds back on itself, and the complementary C&#8211;G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable <span class="term">hairpin</span> that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A&#8211;T nucleotides. The complementary U&#8211;A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2114520">Upon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently. The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these processes occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell (<a href="/#fig-ch15_02_03" data-target-id="fig-ch15_02_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.</p> <figure id="fig-ch15_02_03"><span class="media" id="fs-id1260172" alt="Illustration shows multiple mRNAs transcribed off one gene.
