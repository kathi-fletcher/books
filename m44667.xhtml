This is because it contains two of the most diverse animal groups: phylum Nematoda (the roundworms) and Phylum Arthropoda (the arthropods). The most prominant distinguising feature of Ecdysozoans is their tough external covering called the cuticle. The cuticle provides a tough, but flexible exoskeleton tht protects these animals from water loss, predators and other aspects of the external environment. All members of this superphylum periodically molt, or shed their cuticle as they grow. After molting, they secrete a new cuticle that will last until their next growth phase. The process of molting and replacing the cuticle is called ecdysis, which is how the superphylum derived its name. </p></div><div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idp250233280">Phylum Nematoda</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-idp202650336">The Nematoda, like most other animal phyla, are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm that is sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm. They are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are symmetrical. Furthermore, the nematodes, or roundworms, possess a pseudocoelom and consist of both free-living and parasitic forms.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp151960688">It has been said that were all the non-nematode matter of the biosphere removed, there would remain a shadow of the former world in the form of nematodes.<sup class="sup"><div class="footnote" id="fs-idp141595392">Stoll, N.

Both the nematodes and arthropods belong to the superphylum Ecdysozoa that is believed to be a clade consisting of all evolutionary descendants from one common ancestor. The name derives from the word ecdysis, which refers to the shedding, or molting, of the exoskeleton. The phyla in this group have a hard cuticle that covers their bodies, which must be periodically shed and replaced for them to increase in size.</p><p class="para" id="fs-idp82356032">Phylum <span class="term">Nematoda</span> includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature. The name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word &#8220;Nemos,&#8221; which means &#8220;thread&#8221; and includes roundworms. Nematodes are present in all habitats with a large number of individuals of each species present in each. The free-living nematode, <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Caenorhabditis elegans</em> has been extensively used as a model system in laboratories all over the world.</p> <div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="fs-idp86799824">Morphology</h2> <p class="para" id="fs-idp259828160">In contrast with cnidarians, nematodes show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section.

Some nematodes may present other external modifications like rings, head shields, or warts. Rings, however, do not reflect true internal body segmentation. The mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end.

Specialized structures at the tail of the male keep him in place while he deposits sperm with copulatory spicules. Fertilization is internal, and embryonic development starts very soon after fertilization. The embryo is released from the vulva during the gastrulation stage. The embryonic development stage lasts for 14 hours and results in the formation of three successive larval stages with ecdysis between each stage&#8212;L1, L2, and L3&#8212;ultimately leading to the development of a young adult worm. Adverse environmental conditions like overcrowding and lack of food can result in the formation of an intermediate larval stage known as the dauer larva.</p> <div class="everyday" id="fs-idm519328"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <div class="title">Everyday Connection</div> <p class="para" id="fs-idm205277232"><span class="title"><em class="emphasis" effect="italics">C.</em><em class="emphasis" effect="italics"> elegans</em>: The Model System for Linking Developmental Studies with Genetics</span> If biologists wanted to research how nicotine dependence develops in the body, how lipids are regulated, or observe the attractant or repellant properties of certain odors, they would clearly need to design three very different experiments.

The principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages. Arthropods also show the presence of an exoskeleton made principally of chitin, which is a waterproof, tough polysaccharide. Phylum Arthropoda is the largest phylum in the animal world, and insects form the single largest class within this phylum. Arthropods are eucoelomate, protostomic organisms.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-idp252469232">Phylum Arthropoda includes animals that have been successful in colonizing terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial habitats.

Trilobites are an extinct group of arthropods found chiefly in the pre-Cambrian Era that are probably most closely related to the Chelicerata.

Tagma may be in the form of a head, thorax, and abdomen, or a cephalothorax and abdomen, or a head and trunk. A central cavity, called the <span class="term">hemocoel</span> (or blood cavity), is present, and the open circulatory system is regulated by a two-chambered heart. Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod: insects and myriapods use a series of tubes (tracheae) that ramify through the body, open to the outside through openings called spiracles, and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae, whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills, terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs, and aquatic chelicerates use book gills (<a href="/#fig-ch28_04_05" data-target-id="fig-ch28_04_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). The book lungs of arachnids (scorpions, spiders, ticks and mites) contain a vertical stack of hemocoel wall tissue that somewhat resembles the pages of a book. Between each of the "pages" of tissue is an air space. This allows both sides of the tissue to be in contact with the air at all times, greatly increasing the efficiency of gas exchange. The gills of crustaceans are filamentous structures that exchange gases with the surrounding water. Groups of arthropods also differ in the organs used for excretion, with crustaceans possessing green glands and insects using Malpighian tubules, which work in conjunction with the hindgut to reabsorb water while ridding the body of nitrogenous waste. The cuticle is the covering of an arthropod. It is made up of two layers: the epicuticle, which is a thin, waxy water-resistant outer layer containing no chitin, and the layer beneath it, the chitinous procuticle. Chitin is a tough, flexible polysaccharide. In order to grow, the arthropod must shed the exoskeleton during a process called ecdysis (&#8220;to strip off&#8221;); this is a cumbersome method of growth, and during this time, the animal is vulnerable to predation. The characteristic morphology of representative animals from each subphylum is described below.</p><figure id="fig-ch28_04_05" class=" "><span class="media" id="fs-idp232162096" alt="Part A is a diagram of a spider showing an outline of the body, with the heart and lung inside.

These animals are characterized by a segmented body as well as the presence of jointed appendages. In the basic body plan, a pair of appendages is present per body segment. Within the phylum, traditional classification is based on mouthparts, number of appendages, and modifications of appendages present. Arthropods bear a chitinous exoskeleton. Gills, trachea, and book lungs facilitate respiration.
