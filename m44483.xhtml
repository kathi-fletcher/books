A <span class="term">karyotype</span> is the number and appearance of chromosomes, and includes their length, banding pattern, and centromere position. To obtain a view of an individual&#8217;s karyotype, cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, or <span class="term">karyogram</span>, also known as an ideogram (<a href="/#fig-ch13_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch13_02_01" class=" "> <span class="media" id="fs-id1422041" alt="This is a karyotype of a human female.

In a human karyotype, <span class="term">autosomes</span> or &#8220;body chromosomes&#8221; (all of the non&#8211;sex chromosomes) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes. The shortest chromosome is historically mislabeled 21; it was originally thought to be the shortest, and its label was not corrected because it would mean that name of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) would have to be changed. The chromosome &#8220;arms&#8221; projecting from either end of the centromere may be designated as short or long, depending on their relative lengths. The short arm is abbreviated <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">p </em>(for &#8220;petite&#8221;), whereas the long arm is abbreviated <em class="emphasis" effect="italics">q </em>(because it follows &#8220;p&#8221; alphabetically). Each arm is further subdivided and denoted by a number. Using this naming system, locations on chromosomes can be described consistently in the scientific literature.</p> <div class="career" id="fs-id1419827"><label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/><div class="title">Career Connection</div> <p class="para" id="fs-id2597230"><span class="title">Geneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations</span>Although Mendel is referred to as the &#8220;father of modern genetics,&#8221; he performed his experiments with none of the tools that the geneticists of today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique is karyotyping, a method in which traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities can be identified from a single cell. To observe an individual&#8217;s karyotype, a person&#8217;s cells (like white blood cells) are first collected from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, the isolated cells are stimulated to begin actively dividing. A chemical called colchicine is then applied to cells to arrest condensed chromosomes in metaphase. Cells are then made to swell using a hypotonic solution so the chromosomes spread apart. Finally, the sample is preserved in a fixative and applied to a slide.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2075354">The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize the distinct and reproducible banding patterns of each chromosome pair. Following staining, the chromosomes are viewed using bright-field microscopy. A common stain choice is the Giemsa stain. Giemsa staining results in approximately 400&#8211;800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and condensed proteins) arranged along all of the 23 chromosome pairs; an experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to the banding patterns, chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the classic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order from longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern (<a href="/#fig-ch13_02_01" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_01" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1806671">At its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes per cell. Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of the normal two. Geneticists can also identify large deletions or insertions of DNA. For instance, Jacobsen Syndrome&#8212;which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects&#8212;is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint <span class="term">translocations</span>, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome. Translocations are implicated in certain cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1419233">During Mendel&#8217;s lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that could only be inferred by performing crosses and observing the traits expressed by offspring. By observing a karyogram, today&#8217;s geneticists can actually visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities in offspring, even before birth.</p> </div></div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id2334526">Disorders in Chromosome Number</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1464025">Of all of the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number are the most obviously identifiable from a karyogram.

An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as <span class="term">aneuploid</span>, a term that includes <span class="term">monosomy</span> (loss of one chromosome) or <span class="term">trisomy</span> (gain of an extraneous chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes. This underscores the importance of &#8220;gene dosage&#8221; in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Individuals with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products encoded by that chromosome. This extra dose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development. The most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome. Individuals with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays. The incidence of Down syndrome is correlated with maternal age; older women are more likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype (<a href="/#fig-ch13_02_03" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_03" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch13_02_03"><span class="media" id="fs-id2338862" alt=" This graph shows the risk of Down syndrome in the fetus with increasing maternal age.

For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Polyploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable zygotes. Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species (<a href="/#fig-ch13_02_04" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_04" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).</p> <figure id="fig-ch13_02_04"> <span class="media" id="fs-id1634741" alt=" Photo shows an orange daylily"> <img src="Figure_13_03_04.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="320"/> </span> <figcaption>As with many polyploid plants, this triploid orange daylily (<em class="emphasis" effect="italics">Hemerocallis fulva</em>) is particularly large and robust, and grows flowers with triple the number of petals of its diploid counterparts.

Therefore, it may seem counterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the X chromosome. Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects. In part, this occurs because of a molecular process called <span class="term">X inactivation</span>. Early in development, when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant) structure called a Barr body. The chance that an X chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the inactivation occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same inactive X chromosome or Barr body. By this process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome. In so-called &#8220;tortoiseshell&#8221; cats, embryonic X inactivation is observed as color variegation (<a href="/#fig-ch13_02_05" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_05" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>). Females that are heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever X chromosome is inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region.</p> <figure id="fig-ch13_02_05"><span class="media" id="fs-id1396255" alt=" Photo shows a tortoiseshell cat with orange and black fur."> <img src="Figure_13_03_05.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" width="225"/> </span> <figcaption>In cats, the gene for coat color is located on the X chromosome.

However, even inactivated X chromosomes continue to express a few genes, and X chromosomes must reactivate for the proper maturation of female ovaries. As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop in utero.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2114479">Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-X, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY genotype, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X chromosomes. In all types, every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage. This can be seen as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype (i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.</p> </div> <div class="section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1447048">Duplications and Deletions</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id1727613">In addition to the loss or gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may be duplicated or lost.

Both are identified during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes with their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment.

Inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear, or from the action of transposable elements (special DNA sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences). Unless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation of genes and are likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors. However, altered gene orientation can result in functional changes because regulators of gene expression could be moved out of position with respect to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2018699">An inversion can be <span class="term">pericentric</span> and include the centromere, or <span class="term">paracentric</span> and occur outside of the centromere (<a href="/#fig-ch13_02_07" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_07" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a>).

Disorders in chromosome number, or aneuploidies, are typically lethal to the embryo, although a few trisomic genotypes are viable. Because of X inactivation, aberrations in sex chromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects. Aneuploidies also include instances in which segments of a chromosome are duplicated or deleted. Chromosome structures may also be rearranged, for example by inversion or translocation. Both of these aberrations can result in problematic phenotypic effects. Because they force chromosomes to assume unnatural topologies during meiosis, inversions and translocations are often associated with reduced fertility because of the likelihood of nondisjunction.</p> </div> <div class="art-exercise section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-idm30906320">Art Connections</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-idp32313200"> <div class="problem" id="fs-idp96726576"> <p class="para" id="fs-idm51059280"><a href="/#fig-ch13_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> Which of the following statements about nondisjunction is true?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-idm64108928" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">Nondisjunction only results in gametes with n+1 or n&#8211;1 chromosomes.</li> <li class="item">Nondisjunction occurring during meiosis II results in 50 percent normal gametes.</li> <li class="item">Nondisjunction during meiosis I results in 50 percent normal gametes.</li> <li class="item">Nondisjunction always results in four different kinds of gametes.</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-idp158870160"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-idp9555216"><a href="/#fig-ch13_02_02" data-target-id="fig-ch13_02_02" data-document="" class="autogenerated">[link]</a> B.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="multiple-choice section"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1238553">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2348752"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1693881"><p class="para" id="fs-id2117718">Which of the following codes describes position 12 on the long arm of chromosome 13?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1627623" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">13p12</li> <li class="item">13q12</li> <li class="item">12p13</li> <li class="item">12q13</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2338516"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id2257887">B</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1803123"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1290311"><p class="para" id="fs-id2348913">In agriculture, polyploid crops (like coffee, strawberries, or bananas) tend to produce ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id1290266" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">more uniformity</li> <li class="item">more variety</li> <li class="item">larger yields</li> <li class="item">smaller yields</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id1964677"> <label xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml" class="label"/> <p class="para" id="fs-id2583928">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id1396854"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2936789"><p class="para" id="fs-id2012057">Assume a pericentric inversion occurred in one of two homologs prior to meiosis.
